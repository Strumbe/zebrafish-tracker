# Zebrafish Tracker

This repository contains a Next.js project.

## Remote Repository Setup

This environment does not have a remote Git repository configured. If you want to
push your changes to a remote (e.g., GitHub), first add a remote:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
```

Then push the main branch (or whichever branch you are using):

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `<your-repo-url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository.

## Running the App

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Note on This Environment

The Codex environment used to generate this project has no internet access,
so remote commands like `git push` will fail here. Perform these steps on your
own machine with internet connectivity.
